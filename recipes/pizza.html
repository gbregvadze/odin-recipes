    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Discover how to make traditional spaghetti carbonara. This classic Italian pasta dish combines a silky cheese sauce with crisp pancetta and black pepper.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups warm water(600 mL)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar
        </li>
        <li>7 cups all-purpose flour(875 g), plus more for dusting
        </li>
        <li>
            6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for greasing
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>“Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.
        </li>
        <li>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking sheet and place the stretched crust onto it. Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.
        </li>
        <li>Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.
