    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Using a potato masher, mash the beans until about 
        three-quarters of them are mashed, adding more of your 
        reserved cooking liquid as needed. <br> Remember, 
        youâ€™re going for the consistency of a thick stew 
        but if you would rather make it thinner and go for more of a 
        Georgian bean soup, then just add more liquid.</p>

        <p>Turn off heat. stir in remaining cilantro, and serve.</p>
