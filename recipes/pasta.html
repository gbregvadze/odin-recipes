    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is a pasta dish made <br>
         with eggs, hard cheese, fatty cured pork, and black pepper</p>

         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>100g pancetta</li>
            <li>50g pecorino cheese</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>350g spaghetti</li>
            <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
            <li>
                Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. <br>
                 Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.
            </li>
            <li>Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. <br>
                 Set everything aside</li>
                 <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer,  <br>
                    covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</li>
                    <li>
                        Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. <br>
                         Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, <br>
                         tip in the pancetta and garlic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. <br>
                         Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesnâ€™t scramble, <br>
                         and everything is coated.
                    </li>
         </ol>
